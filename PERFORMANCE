Benchmark results.

TL:DR:
BTREE(arity 5) < AVL < REDBLACK < RREDBLACK 

BTree with arity of 5 is the fastest, beating AVL by ~20%.
AVL is next, consistantly beating redblack by a couple percent.
RedBlack is next, beating rredblack by ~10% due to implementation
RRedblack is lowest, losing another 3% to RedBlack if using the slower balance algorithm

Note: 
  BTree is the only one of these with internal memory allocation, and thus has a different API
  AVL, and RedBlack have identical APIs
  RRedBlack's API differs slightly due to lack of parent pointers, in this way it's simliar to
  BTree (remove takes a key, not a node)

Note that a lot of BTree's performance is probably due to avoiding malloc. Depending on workload, if you already *had* structures and had to copy data in, BTree would likely come out slower than AVL. Similarly, f you have an extremely fast malloc that might change the equation.

Full Experiment: (Redblack vs. RRedblack vs. AVL)

Environment:
This experiment was performed on a Dell XPS 12 convertable laptop/tablet with: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4500U CPU @ 1.80GHz, ubuntu desktop, gcc 4-8-1-10ubuntu9. Linux kernel 3-11.0-19-generic. CPU was in performance mode, and machine wasn't touched during tests. Other things were running, so this is anything but sanitary.

Experiment:
We generate numbers with rand(), for each we check if it's already in the tree with a "get()" if it's not we add it until we've added 20 million values.
Next we walk throgh and remove the values one by one (we stored them in order in an array, and simply remove them in the same order we added them).

That's the benchmark.

To even the playing field I ran the 3 in serial without touching the machine. I run the entire test prior to timing it to make sure the CPU is already running full bore to get rid of order effects. So On that benchmark here's some runtimes (straight off the console):

AVL is the fastest! It should be pretty rare that we randomly select an element in the list.
I'm using "get" to check if the element is already in the tree, if there's a lot of gets that'd give AVL an advantage, so I had it track how many gets. W have twice as many gets as removes or inserts.

Note that I'm not counting remove(get(i)) as a get, partly because that confuses matters with rredblack where that's not how it works.

So, that workload is a bit AVL biased I guess, but overal it's only ~2% between the AVL and RedBlack on this workload. Also interestingly the recursive redblack tree sucks. That's about 13% worse! Earlier tests I ran came up with the same number. 

So, there we have it. AVL and redblack are awesome, and the recursive version is much slower... sadness. 

Now to test if the workload was AVL biased, I tried biasing it MORE twoards the AVL by tripling the number of gets, when I check if the element is in the tree, I do it 3 times making it 60 million gets instead of 20. Here's the results.

I accidentally ran it twice and you can see the difference is well inside the variance. AVL should've gained on redblack in this scenerio, if those 20k gets were why AVL was doing well... but it did not. 

This implies that AVL and redblack are actually about equivelent - except that AVL find is still faster than redblack (code is the same, and it might not have to go as deep).

Givne this, I would be inclined to use the AVL implementation as things stand. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Followup test (RRedBlack simple algorithm vs. faster algorithm)

To isolate whether RRedBlack is slow due to algorithmic choice, I implemented the other algorithm. It now has a compile switch "SIMPLER_ALGORITHM" which switches it between the slightly more elegant algorithm, and the one more standard one used by RedBlack.

I ran repeated tests, making sure the CPU was loaded prior to the test running - not as rigorously as above, but carefully and several times, and got about this result every time for the new algorithm:

0,0 me@blackbox:C++11$ g++ -O3 --std=c++11 rredblack_benchmark.cpp 
0,0 me@blackbox:C++11$ time ./a.out
Begin RRedBlack.h benchmark
gets 20093205

real  0m55.269s
user  0m54.975s
sys 0m0.320s

As you can see, it is faster... but not much. This explains maybe 3% of the performance loss compared to RedBlack, but not the other 10%. The recursive implementation is simply slower - presumably due to lack of short-circuiting, and modification of the tree as we walk back up it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BTree vs. AVL tree

ckbox:C++11$ g++ -O3 --std=c++11 btree_benchmark.cpp && time ./a.out && g++ -O3 --std=c++11 avl_benchmark.cpp && time ./a.out
Begin BTree.h benchmark
gets 20093205

real  0m42.371s
user  0m42.077s
sys 0m0.315s
Begin AVL.h benchmark
gets 20093205

real  0m51.720s
user  0m51.357s
sys 0m0.384s

Note, BTW, that btree is *extrordinarilly* slow when compiled only O2. running some quick profiling this appears to be due to the accessors I wrote on the BTreeNode class for data and such. Basically, the abstraction costs, and until O3 the complier isn't stripping out those extra calls.
