New:
  Write hashtable using array (rather than dlist) for open chaining
  Write a skiplist
  Write medianfind (and variants)

Cleanup:
  consider replacing comparators with lambdas
  review for move semantics (arrays especially)
  decltype (sorts especially, can probably replace some templating) 
  drop arrays in favor of vector due to "emplace"

Usability:
  Write translations from Array -> Set, dict
  Make initializers work for everything
