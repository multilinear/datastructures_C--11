overall principle:
  I'd like to build a library that optimizes worse-case rather than average case
  usage, while still trying to bring average down to a usable range.

ABSTRACT STRUCTURES
(See files for most cases)

Stack:
  we do not provide a stack interface, becaues array works well for the quick-hacking use-cases 
  More involved use you can use any of array, list, or dlist

CONCRETE STRUCTURES
(See files for most cases)
