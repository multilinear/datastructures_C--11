 *
 * When to use this:
 * Don't, avl.h is strictly superior for the same use-cases
 * I'm leaving this code here for comparison/demonstration purposes
 *
 * How to use this library:
 *  You can look at the unittest for an example.
 *  Basically, include this file, write a new "node" class that inherits
 *  from RedBlackNode_base, you'll have to pass the classname into the
 *  template as well.
 *
 *  This class will need a "compare" and a "val" methods. See
 *  RedBlackNode_base for details on these methods.
 *  You may also want to supply a "print" method to aid in debugging
 *  of your class... yeah we should probably sprintf, but I didn't feel like it
 *
 *  In case it's not obvious, you allocate you're own memory for use in this
 *  class.
 * 
 * Invariants:
 * - Root is always black
 * - Leaves are always black
 * - Red nodes can only have black children
 * - Every path from from any node N to it's descendants has the same number
 *    of black nodes 
 *
 * For comparitive performance of structures see
 * PERFORMANCE
 *
 * Design Decisions:
 *
 *   We use no recursion (except traversals):
 * Really, it doesn't much matter, but it was just as easy to write it
 * non-recursively. Most likely this won't hurt the compiler, and it
 * means we don't have to hope it'll catch that the functions are tail
 * recursive. *Shrug*, why not.
 *
 *   We do not use malloc ourselves:
 * This is written so the user defines what's in the nodes, allowing them
 * to allocate things however they want. It's more flexible and has no
 * downsides really except the extra templating.
 *
 *   We avoid virtual:
 * Because of the templating we can get away without it for the node class.
 * Virtual costs a jump indirect. For compare this would occur for every
 * walk down the tree searching for a node. So we don't use it.
 *
 *   We have some redundancy:
 * There's a bit of redundancy in the code with the mirror-image versions of
 * the code often both being written out explicitly. This is in hopes of better
 * optimization by the compiler. We could do it left/right as an array, thus
 * allowing moduler arithmatic to take care of the mirror cases. But, it will
 * probably not be optimized as well by the compiler.
 *
 *   Not much abstraction:
 * If you look through the cases you'll see that we avoid a LOT of coditional
 * branches by not abstracting out things like rotations and re-parenting. In
 * most cases we have some information that lets us elide some conditionals
 * Thus abstraction would improve readability but at the cost of efficiency.
 * As a core library we decided we could debug it once, and it'd be worth it.
 * 
 * Threadsafety:
 *  thread compatible
