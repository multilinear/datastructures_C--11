Comparing doubling array, with a doubling copy array as backing
store for a standard heap implementation.
Note that both include resizing down when below 1/3 (switching to 1/2 seems to have little impact)

TEST_SIZE 100000000
PASSES 1

Normal heap:
real  0m35.485s
user  0m35.380s

DelayedCopy heap:
real  0m41.140s
user  0m40.920s
sys 0m0.220s

= 15% longer
